## Main Features

### Automated Change Requests

Reduce code review noise by catching issues before anyone invests precious time. Flag [deprecated components](https://docs.gitstream.cm/automations/change-deprecated-components), [missing data objects](https://docs.gitstream.cm/automations/change-missing-lambda-field/), [off-limits code](https://docs.gitstream.cm/automations/close-wrong-team-by-directory/), and other problems that need to be addressed before assigning code reviewers.

### Review Assignment

Identifying the correct people to review a PR can take time, particularly for complex projects and repos requiring deep expertise. [Assign code experts](https://docs.gitstream.cm/automations/assign-code-experts/) to review complex PRs, [notify your security team about sensitive changes](https://docs.gitstream.cm/automations/review-sensitive-files/), and automatically [assign reviewers based on the contents of the PR](https://docs.gitstream.cm/automations/assign-reviewers-by-directory/).
### Auto-Merge PRs

Not all PRs need extensive review policies that loop in multiple experts. gitStream lets you auto-merge [safe changes](https://docs.gitstream.cm/automations/approve-safe-changes/), [small fixes](https://docs.gitstream.cm/automations/approve-tiny-changes/), [PRs from trusted teams](https://docs.gitstream.cm/automations/approve-team-by-directory/), and anything else you want to unblock the review process to keep your team focused on their work.

### Contextual Labels

Reduce the mental burden of code reviews with labels that provide a high degree of context. Indicate an [estimated time to review](https://docs.gitstream.cm/automations/provide-estimated-time-to-review/) or flag potential issues with [Jira information](https://docs.gitstream.cm/automations/label-missing-jira-info/), [missing tests](https://docs.gitstream.cm/automations/label-prs-without-tests/), [deleted files](https://docs.gitstream.cm/automations/label-deleted-files/), and more.

## Local Documentation Server Setup

To run the documentation server locally using Python3, follow these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment named `.venv` using the command `python -m venv .venv`
2. Activate the virtual environment by running the command `. ./.venv/bin/activate`
3. Install the required packages by executing `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Start the server by running `mkdocs serve`

The local documentation server should now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
