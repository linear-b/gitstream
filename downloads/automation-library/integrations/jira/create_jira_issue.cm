###### ** Configure This Section ** ######

# Configure this for your Jira instance and the email associated with your API key.
# You can safely use these values because only your API key is sensitive. 
jiraSpaceName: "my-company" # e.g. my-company.atlassian.net
email: "my.email@example.com"
# If you're concerned about exposing this information,
# we recommend using environment variables for your production environment.

# -----------

# Pass the API token associated with the email above to gitStream via an environment variable.
jiraAuth: {{ env.JIRA_API_TOKEN }}
# Learn more about env: https://docs.gitstream.cm/context-variables/#env

# Change this to the Jira field you want to match the input string against.
jiraField: "myField"
# If you want to search a custom field, you should provide the ID like so:
# jiraField: "cf[XXXXX]"
# Replace XXXXX with the ID of the custom field you want to search.
