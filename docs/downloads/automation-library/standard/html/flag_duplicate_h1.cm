              The file being modified has a duplicate H1 heading. Please create only one H1 for the main heading. Creating one H1 Heading creates a meaningful structure and makes it easy for indexing search engines.

duplicateH1: {{ source.diff.files | filter(attr='new_content', regex=r/<h1>(.|\n)*<h1>/) | length }}
