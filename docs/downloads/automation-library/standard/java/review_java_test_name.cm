              The test file name does not follow the Java test name conventions. A test file name needs to have the word Test at the end of class name. For example, if you are testing a class called Data then the test file name has to be DataTest.java.

is:
    java: {{ files | extensions | match(term='java') | every }}
    new: {{ source.diff.files | map(attr='original_file') | match(regex=r/^$/) }}
