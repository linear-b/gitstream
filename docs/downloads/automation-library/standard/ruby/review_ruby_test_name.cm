              The test file name does not follow the Ruby test name conventions. A test file name needs to have the suffix _spec after class name. For example, if you are testing a class file called data.rb then the test file name has to be data_spec.rb.

is:
    ruby: {{ files | extensions | match(term='rb') | every }}
    new: {{ source.diff.files | map(attr='original_file') | match(regex=r/^$/) }}
