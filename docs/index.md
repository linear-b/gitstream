	**Auto-Merge PRs**

	Not all PRs need extensive review policies that loop in multiple experts. gitStream lets you auto-merge [safe changes](automations/approve-safe-changes/README.md), [small fixes](automations/approve-tiny-changes/README.md), [PRs from trusted teams](automations/approve-team-by-directory/README.md), and anything else you want to unblock the review process to keep your team focused on their work.

	![Estimated time to review](assets/etr-label-highlight.png){: style="border-radius:4px;width:50%", align=left}

	**Contextual Labels**

	Reduce the mental burden of code reviews with labels that provide a high degree of context. Indicate an [estimated time to review](automations/provide-estimated-time-to-review/README.md) or flag potential issues with [Jira information](automations/integrations/jira/label-missing-jira-info/README.md), [missing tests](automations/label-prs-without-tests/README.md), [deleted files](automations/label-deleted-files/README.md), and more.

	![Assign Code Experts](assets/code-experts-highlight.png){: style="border-radius:4px;width:50%", align=right}

	**Review Assignment**

	Identifying the correct people to review a PR can take time, particularly for complex projects and repos requiring deep expertise. [Assign code experts](automations/standard/review-assignment/assign-code-experts/README.md) to review complex PRs, [notify your security team about sensitive changes](automations/standard/review-assignment/review-sensitive-files/README.md), and automatically [assign reviewers based on the contents of the PR](automations/assign-reviewers-by-directory/README.md).

	**Automated Change Requests**
	
	Reduce code review noise by catching issues before anyone invests precious time. Flag [deprecated components](automations/change-deprecated-components/README.md), [missing data objects](automations/change-missing-lambda-field/README.md), [off-limits code](automations/close-wrong-team-by-directory/README.md), and other problems that need to be addressed before assigning code reviewers.
