# Automatically Label AI-Assisted PRs
<!-- --8<-- [start:example]-->
Automatically apply labels to PRs based on whether they were assisted by AI tools. Developers can indicate the specific AI tools or models used, or pre-add an AI-related label to skip the prompt.

=== "Ask Developers About AI Assistance"
    ### Ask Developers About AI Assistance
    Prompt PR authors with a convenient checkbox survey to indicate which AI tools they used for the PR. Developers can pre-add any `🤖 ai-*` label to skip the question. The automation checks for existing labels before posting the prompt.

    ![Ask About AI Assistance](/automations/integrations/ai-assistance/flag-ai-pr/ask-ai-assistance.png)

    !!! info "Configuration Description"
        Conditions:

        * A PR is created, and no `🤖 ai-*` label is pre-applied.
        * The question hasn't been asked before.

        Automation Actions:

        * Post a comment with a checkbox survey about AI tools used.
        * Apply labels based on the checkboxes selected.

    !!! example "Ask the PR author about AI assistance."
        ```yaml+jinja
        --8<-- "docs/downloads/automation-library/integrations/ai-assistance/comment_ai_prompt.cm"
        ```
        <div class="result" markdown>
        <span>
        [:octicons-download-24: Download this example as a CM file.](/downloads/automation-library/integrations/ai-assistance/comment_ai_prompt.cm){ .md-button }
        </span>
        </div>


    ### Track AI Tools
    Add labels to the PR according to the tools that the developer checked in the micro-survey above

    !!! info "Configuration Description"
        Conditions:

        * A PR with selected checkboxes for AI tools used.
        * Optional: Details about AI Service and Model specified.

        Automation Actions:

        * Apply labels for specific AI tools (e.g., `🤖 ai-copilot`, `🤖 ai-cursor`).
        * Apply labels for AI services and models if provided.

    !!! example "Track AI tools, models and services."
        ```yaml+jinja
        --8<-- "docs/downloads/automation-library/integrations/ai-assistance/track_ai_models.cm"
        ```
        <div class="result" markdown>
        <span>
        [:octicons-download-24: Download this example as a CM file.](/downloads/automation-library/integrations/ai-assistance/track_ai_models.cm){ .md-button }
        </span>
        </div>

=== "Skip the survey for known users"
    ### Ask Developers About AI Assistance
    The automation will not prompt known users for AI assistance. This allows a smoother experience for users who were predefined as AI users, to avoid answering the same questions again. 
    !!! example "Skip the survey for known users."
        ```yaml+jinja
        --8<-- "docs/downloads/automation-library/integrations/ai-assistance/comment_ai_prompt_with_known_users.cm"
        ```
        <div class="result" markdown>
        <span>
        [:octicons-download-24: Download this example as a CM file.](/downloads/automation-library/integrations/ai-assistance/comment_ai_prompt_with_known_users.cm){ .md-button }
        </span>
        </div>
