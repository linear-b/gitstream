# Automatically Label Amazon Q PRs
<!-- --8<-- [start:example]-->
Automatically apply labels to PRs that are assisted by Amazon Q. You can apply labels based on a known list of Amazon Q users, PR tags, or by prompting the PR author to indicate if they used Amazon Q.

=== "Label by Prompt"
    Prompt PR authors to indicate if they used Amazon Q for the PR and automatically label the PR if they did. This requires two separate automation files to handle posting the prompt and labeling accordingly.
