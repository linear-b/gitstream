# gitStream Quickstart Examples

This page contains common gitStream configurations that are a great place to get started with gitStream. For a more detailed list, check out the [gitStream automation library](automations/automation-library.md).

!!! tip "How to use these examples."
    These examples are all complete gitStream configuration files that you can download directly via the buttons below the examples and upload to the `.cm` directory of your repo. Alternatively, you can copy and paste the individual automations, but make sure you include all required declarations and any related custom expressions from the configurations to ensure they work properly. 

## Assign Code Experts

When someone applies a `suggest-reviewers` label to a PR, use codeExperts to assign recommended reviewers and post a comment with the `explainCodeExperts` automation action.

    ```yaml+jinja
    --8<-- "docs/downloads/automation-library/assign_code_experts.cm"
