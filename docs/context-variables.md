## Overview

### Context

gitStream includes a collection of variables called contexts. 

- [`branch`](#branch) :fontawesome-brands-github: :fontawesome-brands-gitlab:
- [`env`](#env) :fontawesome-solid-flask: :fontawesome-brands-github:
- [`files`](#files) :fontawesome-brands-github: :fontawesome-brands-gitlab:
- [`pr`](#pr) :fontawesome-brands-github: :fontawesome-brands-gitlab:
- [`repo`](#repo) :fontawesome-brands-github: :fontawesome-brands-gitlab:
- [`source`](#source) :fontawesome-brands-github: :fontawesome-brands-gitlab:

### Structures

The following structures are used in the context objects:

- [`GitBlame`](#gitblamep-structure)
- :octicons-beaker-24: [`Check`](#check-structure)
- [`Contributor`](#contributor-structure)
- [`FileDiff`](#filediff-structure)
- [`FileMetadata`](#filemetadata-structure)
- [`Comment`](#comment-structure)
- [`conversations`](#conversation-structure)

???+ example "Example of a context object"

    Partial example of a context object for a PR that changed few lines in a `README.md` file:

    ```json
    {
      "branch": {
        "name": "new-feature-branch",
        "base": "main",
        "diff": {
          "size": 50,
          "files_metadata": [
            {
              "original_file": "README.md",
              "new_file": "README.md",
              "deletions": 0,
              "additions": 2
            }
          ]
        },
        "num_of_commits": 1
      },
      "source": {
        "diff": {
          "files": [
            {
              "original_file": "README.md",
              "new_file": "README.md",
              "diff": "@@ -10,3 +10,5 @@ This project \n+\n+## Intro",
              "original_content": "This project \n",
              "new_content": "This project \n\n## Intro"
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      "repo": {
        "contributors": {
          "popeye": "46",
          "olive": "6"
        },
        "owner": "acme"
      },
      "files": [
        "README.md"
      ]
    }
    ```

## Reference

#### `branch`

The `branch` context contains info regarding the branch changes compared to the base branch. 

!!! note  

    compared to the `source` context does not include actual source code.

| Values               | Type      | Description                                              |
|----------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------- |
| `branch`             | Map       | Includes the info related to the current branch          |
| `branch.author`      | String    | The branch author (the user that did first commit in the branch). The formatted like author in `git-log`, e.g. `Popeye <popeye@acme.com>`        |
| `branch.author_name`      | String    | The branch author name        |
| `branch.author_email`      | String    | The branch author email       |
| `branch.base`        | String    | The main branch, `main`                 |
| :octicons-beaker-24: `branch.commits.messages` | [String] | A list with all the commit messages in this branch  |
| `branch.diff.size`   | Integer   | The sum of line changed: additions, edits and deletions   |
| `branch.diff.files_metadata`  | [`FileMetadata`](#filemetadata-structure)  | List of changed files including their relative path      |
| `branch.name`        | String    | The current branch, `feature-123-branch`                 |
| `branch.num_of_commits` | Integer   | The number of commits in the branch |

The branch context doesn't include any source code, but only related metadata.

Example for using `branch.name` and `branch.author` to automatically approve and merge version bumps.

```yaml+jinja
automations:
  dependabot:
    if:
      - {{ branch.name | includes(term="dependabot") }}
      - {{ branch.author | includes(term="dependabot") }}
    run:
      - action: approve@v1
      - action: add-label@v1
        args:
          label: "approved-dependabot"
      - action: merge@v1
        args:
          wait_for_all_checks: true
          squash_on_merge: true
```

!!! tip

    The `files` context doesn't include deleted file, to identify both modified and deleted files use the `branch.diff.files_metadata`, for example: 
    ```
    {{ branch.diff.files_metadata | match(attr='file', regex=r/\.md$/) | every }}
    ```

#### `env` :fontawesome-solid-flask:  :fontawesome-brands-github:

The `env` context allows the user to pass data from the repo that is unavailable in the other context variables. Thus, the structure of the variable is not fixed and depends on user configuration.

To configure the `env` variable, add the `env` field to gitstream's workflow job configurations on `.github/workflows/gitstream.yml`, under the `Evaluate Rules` step. For more information, visit GitHub's guide for [Using secrets in GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions)
The `env` field 
```yaml title="examle: add secrets to the env variable"
...
    name: gitStream workflow automation
    steps:
      - name: Evaluate Rules
        env:
          SLACK_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SLACK_TOKEN }}
...
```

To use the context variable, access to the `env` variable's fields as configured in `gitstream.yml`

```yaml+jinja title=" example: use slack webhook secret"
automations:
  send_slack:
    if:
      - true
    run:
      - action: send-slack-message@v1
        args:
          message: "Hello world :tada:."
          webhook_url: "{{ slack_webhook }}"

slack_webhook: {{ env.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
```
https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions
#### `files`

The `files` context includes the list of changed files in the branch compared to the main branch.

| Values  | Type      | Description                                |
|---------|-----------|------------------------ |
| `files` | [String]  | List of all changed files with their full path |

For example, a typical `files` context can look like this: 

```json
[
  "README.md",
  "package.json",
  "src/app.js",
  "src/index.js",
  "docs/examples.md"

```

Example for checking if certain changes are made:

```yaml+jinja

  ui_review:
    if:
      - {{ files | match(list=ui_templates_files) | some }}
    run:
      - action: add-reviewers@v1
        args:
          reviewers: [GitHubUser1, GitHubUser2]
