# How to Setup gitStream with GitLab

!!! info "Prerequisites"

    1. GitLab
    2. GitLab runner v15 or higher with ability to run apk commands
    3. <a href="https://app.linearb.io/login" target="_blank">Login</a>, or <a href="https://app.linearb.io/sign-up" target="_blank">create a free account</a> on the LinearB app, and follow the steps to <a href="https://linearb.helpdocs.io/article/0xxpvue4s9-connect-git-stream-using-a-git-lab-integration" target="_blank">connect gitStream Using a GitLab Integration</a>.
    4. Allowed network connection between the executors and the following IPs:
        - 13.56.203.235
        - 54.151.81.98

??? Info "Understanding IP Allowlisting for gitStream"
    When setting up IP allowlists in GitLab, you're specifying which source IP addresses are permitted to interact with your repositories and APIs. This affects both gitStream and your CI/CD runners.

    There are two primary cases where this matters for gitStream:

    1. **Webhook Event Handling by gitStream**
       When GitLab triggers a webhook event (e.g., a merge request opened), gitStream may need to make follow-up API calls to GitLab. This can include fetching additional metadata, posting comments to the MR, or performing other actions. These calls are made from the LinearB/gitStream service, which uses a fixed set of IP addresses. These IPs must be added to your GitLab allowlist to ensure proper operation.
    2. **Outbound Requests from Your CI Runner**
       When your pipeline runs gitStream, that runner might also make outbound calls to GitLabâ€”for example, to clone a repository or retrieve commit history. These requests will originate from the runner's IP address.

    If you encounter errors due to blocked IPs during your CI runs, it's likely that the runner is using an IP that is not part of the configured allowlist.

    **Recommended Solution**
    To ensure reliability:

    - Add LinearB/gitStream service IPs to your GitLab allowlist (listed above).
    - Use self-hosted runners or runners with static IPs so you can manage and allowlist their addresses explicitly.

    This combination ensures that both gitStream's internal operations and your CI runners' interactions with GitLab function without network restrictions.

GitLab Installation Overview

1. Designate a gitStream user account.
1. Create a `cm` repo and `.cm` configuration file.
1. Create a GitLab pipeline.
1. Connect gitStream in LinearB.

## Designate a gitStream User Account

gitStream automation rules are executed on behalf of the user account configured when you connect gitStream to your GitLab instance. This account must have the appropriate permissions to the relevant repositories.

- The account must have the `maintainer` or `owner` role to the relevant repos
- We recommend creating a [dedicated service account](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/service_accounts.html){:target="_blank"} to control access to individual repos easily. A meaningful account identifier whose name contains the string `gitstream` (case insensitive), such as `gitStream-cm`, is recommended to ensure clarity and proper identification of the automated actions
- You can also use your professional or personal GitLab account, though this would result in all automations being executed under that account, which might also affect LinearB's metrics

!!! tip "Use this account when you integrate gitStream"
    Make sure to use this account when authorizing GitLab in LinearB.

## Create a `cm` repo and `.cm` configuration file.

Create a `cm` project (repository) in your GitLab group. This repository must be created in the same group or parent group as the target repositories. In the root directory of the default branch (usually `master` or `main`), create a `gitstream.cm` rules file to define the workflow automations. The file name can vary but must end in `.cm`.

!!! info "Configuration File Locations"
	Group-level rules require your `.cm` files to be placed in the `cm` repository's root directory.
	You can also define specific repo-level rules under the `.cm` folder in each of the connected repositories.

!!! example "Example Configuration"
		--8<-- "docs/downloads/gitStream-gl.cm"

!!! warning "Explicit triggers are not supported"
    The `triggers` and `on` functionality are not currently supported in GitLab. If you include them in your CM automation files, gitStream will skip the automations entirely.

## Create a GitLab Pipeline

Once your gitStream configuration file is set up, you need a GitLab CI configuration file to trigger gitStream automations. Create a `cm` project (repository) in your GitLab group if you haven't already. It should be created in the same group or a parent group of the target repositories. Create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in your new `cm` repository's default branch (usually `master` or `main`) and add the following configuration:

=== "GitLab-Hosted runners"

    **Gitlab-Hosted Runners**

    Use the following `.gitlab-ci.yml`

	``` yaml+jinja
    --8<-- "docs/downloads/gitlab-ci.yml"
    ```

=== "Self-Managed Runners - Shell"
    **Self-Managed Runners**

	First, [register the runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/){:target="_blank"} with a tag, and use the named tag in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file

	**Shell executors**

	Use the tag created above in the workflow file `cm/.gitlab-ci.yml` instead `REGISTERED-TAG`
    ``` yaml+jinja
    --8<-- "docs/downloads/gitlab-shell-ci.yml"
    ```

=== "Self-Managed Runners - Kubernetes"
    **Self-Managed Runners**

	First, [register the runner](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/register/){:target="_blank"} with a tag, and use the named tag in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file

	**Kubernetes executors**

    1. Ensure your runner configuration (`config.toml` for example) has the followig:
	``` yaml
	[runners.kubernetes]
    privileged = true
	```
	2. Use the tag created above in the workflow file `cm/.gitlab-ci.yml` instead `REGISTERED-TAG`
    ``` yaml+jinja
    --8<-- "docs/downloads/gitlab-k8s-ci.yml"
    ```

!!! tip "**Configuring the image location**"
	By default, gitStream pulls the image from DockerHub each time it is invoked. You can configure gitStream to pull the docker image from your own registry, to allow faster build times and reduced bandwidth usage - especially for teams with high CI/CD throughput, by downloading the image and storing it in your own registry (ECR or K8S registry, for example) and changing the `cm/.gitlab-ci.yml` accordingly:
	```
	script:
    - ...
    - docker pull YOUR-REGISTRY-URL/gitstream/rules-engine:latest
	```
	The docker image can be pulled to your private repository from [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/gitstream/rules-engine){:target=_blank}.

## Connect gitStream in LinearB

To complete the setup, connect gitStream in LinearB. Follow the instructions in the LinearB app to connect your GitLab account and repositories to gitStream.

## Next Step
If you complete these instructions, gitStream will now automate your Merge Request workflows on GitLab.

### Required GitLab Permissions

The required permissions are:
