# User Commands

User commands allow you to trigger specific gitStream actions manually by adding comments to pull requests. These commands provide on-demand execution of automation actions without requiring changes to your `.cm` configuration files.

!!! note "GitHub Only & v2 Action Required"

    User commands are only supported on **GitHub** and require the `linear-b/gitstream-github-action@v2`. This feature is not available on GitLab or Bitbucket.

## Overview

gitStream supports comment-triggered actions that allow you to execute specific automations on-demand. Commands are only processed when **new comments are added**, not when existing comments are edited.

gitStream provides visual feedback through emoji reactions on command comments. :eyes: is added when a command is recognized and processing begins
and :thumbsup: is added when the command has been successfully executed.
