# FAQ

## What permissions are needed?

In your repo permissions, make sure GitHub actions are permitted:

Go to Repo's settings > Actions > General > Actions permissions

Choose which repositories are permitted to use GitHub Actions.

[x] Allow all actions and reusable workflows

## Does gitStream have access to my code?

Like any other CI/CD automation, the source code is being scanned in the repo and is not shared with any external services. By default, only metadata related to and affecting the workflow is shared to allow rule-based automation on the repo. Your own gitStream plugins that may connect to other services, such as using the [`askAI`](/filter-function-plugins/#askai) plugin which will provide context to the configured model provider.

## Why does gitStream require permission to write code?

To support automations that either Approve or Merge PRs, the git providers require code write scope.

## What repos are supported?

gitStream supports repositories in GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. Note that the `add-label` action is not supported in Bitbucket as it does not have a native labeling feature.

## Are there limits on gitStream automations for free accounts?

Yes. Free accounts have a monthly limit on the number of PRs that can trigger automations.  

- When the organization reaches 90% of the limit, a warning will appear in PR comments.  
- Once the limit is exceeded, new PRs will not trigger automations and will be marked as "Skipped."  
- The limit resets at the start of each month.

## Can I use gitStream with Merge Queues?

Yes. When a merge queue is used, and gitStream is set as a required check, gitStream automation will be invoked with the merge event. The automation will set gitStream to a `Completed` status and `Skipped` conclusion to allow the PR merge.

## Is there .cm syntax highlighting?

The `.cm` file uses YAML with JINJA2. For your favorite editor to automatically choose the right syntax, you can use modelines.

Add the following line to the top of the `.cm` file (the default has it already):

```
# -*- mode: yaml -*-
```

Get a plug-in that enables modelines. Popular ones are:

- VS Code: [Modelines](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chrislajoie.vscode-modelines)
- Sublime Text: [CM syntax for ST4](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Continuous%20Merge) or [Emacs-like Sublime Modeline](https://github.com/kvs/STEmacsModelines)
- Vim [Modeline magic](https://vim.fandom.com/wiki/Modeline_magic)
