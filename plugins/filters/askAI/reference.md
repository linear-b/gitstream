## askAI
The AskAI plugin allows gitStream workflows to interact with external AI services, enabling advanced automation capabilities such as code analysis, test case generation, and PR summarization. This plugin requires a valid API token for the AI service, which must be securely provided as an environment variable.

!!! note "Security note"
    The `AskAI` plugin integrates with an external AI model and requires your API token for authorization. Ensure you provide a valid token through the `env.OPEN_AI_TOKEN` parameter or similar configuration. This may also incur API costs.

    When using the `AskAI` plugin, the provided **context** and **prompt** will be shared with the configured AI service. **Ensure that no sensitive or proprietary information is included unless your organization's policies permit it**.
